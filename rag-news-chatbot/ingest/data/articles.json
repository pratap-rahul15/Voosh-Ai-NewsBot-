Some Labour MPs have become more vocal in their criticism of the prime minister after the departures of Angela Rayner and Peter Mandelson. The prime minister said the flag represents \"our diverse country\" and he will not allow people to feel intimidated. Business Secretary Peter Kyle says Robinson has been able to tap into a years-long sense of grievance in the country. The Foreign Office says the group of children will arrive in the UK \"in the coming days\". Some Labour MPs have become more vocal in their criticism of the prime minister after the departures of Angela Rayner and Peter Mandelson. Key among the plans is a proposal to build up to 12 advanced modular nuclear reactors in Hartlepool. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson launches her Labour deputy leadership bid in Sunderland. The prime minister said the flag represents \"our diverse country\" and he will not allow people to feel intimidated. If anyone can get the president's attention, King Charles and the Royal Family must be close to the top of the list. The fallout is continuing after Peter Mandelson's sacking as UK ambassador to Washington over his links to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. Dozens of migrants were detained in Dover last month under the new 'one in, one out' agreement between the UK and France. The Reform leader is facing questions about how his partner could afford to buy the house in his constituency. Mandelson was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US over his links to the late convicted paedophile. There is growing disquiet over the roles of Starmer, his chief of staff and Whitehall vetting in the saga. Many Labour MPs think the prime minister should have seen the Mandelson scandal coming a mile off, writes Joe Pike. The winning candidate - voted for by Labour members - will be announced on 25 October. Lord Mandelson's departure follows a similar pattern to that of deputy prime minister Angela Rayner. For 40 years the wily operator made himself indispensable to successive Labour leaders - but has also caused them headaches. There is a drip, drip of revelations about the UK's ambassador's past links to Jeffrey Epstein - and calls for his resignation. The ripple effects of the Angela Rayner saga roll on as six candidates make their pitch for deputy. Nominations for the new deputy leader of the Labour Party open today with a winner announced on 25 October. The conference feels like that of a big party - but retains the insurgency vibe that the party is seeking to channel. The prime minister knows he needs to be seen to be delivering and quickly - and he has to hope this new team can do it. The start of this political season has been wild, writes Laura Kuenssberg, and Labour now has Reform UK breathing down its neck. Some say Britain's decision is an important first step – while others worry it won't make a real difference, writes BBC's International Editor Jeremy Bowen. It's been a week of dismissals, disagreements and backbench bust-ups, writes Laura Kuenssberg. What’s gone wrong for Labour? 2024 voters delve into it, writes Laura Kuenssberg.
